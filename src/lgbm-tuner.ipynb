    "[Optuna](https://optuna.org/) is one of the best and easiest to use libraries for optimization. Its' API allows for great flexibility when it comes to creating, stopping and editing trials making it a very important tool for Kaggle contests. Since Optuna has a specialized API for XGBoost models, we will use it to speed up the search."
